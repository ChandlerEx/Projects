## Electronics & Maker Projects

Welcome! This is a collection of my hands-on electronics and product design builds — each project blends embedded programming, hardware integration, and 3D-printed enclosures.
They’re documented here both as a personal portfolio and as a resource for anyone interested in building similar devices.

|---------|-----------------------|-------------|---------|
| [**The Orb**](./TheOrb) | [Quick Details and Build Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/main/TheOrb/docs/Orb_One_Sheet.pdf) | Ambient LED orb that visualizes live stock performance through color and pulsing light. Powered by an ESP8266 D1 Mini with custom PCB, in a 3D-printed enclosure topped with a frosted glass globe. | <img src="https://github.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/blob/4fce6b1c45c0433fd5aaa784d1d3e17cac22d64d/TheOrb/OrbThumb.jpg" alt="The Orb" width="150"/> |
| [**Soil Moisture Monitor**](./SoilMonitor) | [Quick Details and Build Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/main/SoilMonitor/docs/SoilMon_One_Sheet.pdf) | Battery-powered OLED moisture monitor that tells plant lovers when to water. Built with a XIAO nRF52840 and capacitive sensor, in a precision-fit 3D-printed enclosure with code optimized for succulents. | <img src="https://github.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/blob/bd44a9a6053a92f3da4370e4cfcf0bc38572fa22/SoilMonitor/SoilMonInUse.jpg" alt="Soil Monitor" width="150"/> |
| [**Scoreboard**](./Scoreboard) | [Quick Details and Build Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/main/Scoreboard/docs/Scoreboard_One_Sheet.pdf) | Desk-friendly digital clock with a hidden touchscreen that displays live MLB game data on demand. Uses an ESP32 CYD with custom 3D-printed enclosure and captive portal Wi-Fi setup. | <img src="https://github.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/blob/bd44a9a6053a92f3da4370e4cfcf0bc38572fa22/Scoreboard/ScoreboardScore.jpg" alt="Scoreboard" width="150"/> |

## About Me
I’m Chandler, an IT professional turned maker, focused on creating embedded electronics that work as well as they look. My builds combine purposeful hardware integration, 
thoughtful UX, and custom enclosures modeled from scratch in Fusion 360. I approach each project as both an engineering challenge and a design exercise, aiming for devices 
that are reliable, visually refined, and ready for real-world use.
