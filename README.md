## Electronics & Maker Projects

Welcome! This is a collection of my hands-on electronics and product design builds — each project blends embedded programming, hardware integration, and 3D-printed enclosures.
They’re documented here both as a personal portfolio and as a resource for anyone interested in building similar devices.

## Projects
| Project | Description | Preview |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| [**Soil Moisture Monitor**](./SoilMonitor) | Battery-powered monitor for a succulent, with OLED display, capacitive moisture sensor, and ultra-low power sleep mode. Designed for accurate plant care without overwatering. | <img src="https://github.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/blob/bd44a9a6053a92f3da4370e4cfcf0bc38572fa22/SoilMonitor/SoilMonInUse.jpg" alt="Soil Monitor" width="150"/> |
| [**Scoreboard**](./Scoreboard) | Desk-friendly MLB scoreboard showing Yankees game status, first pitch alerts, and live updates. Uses an ESP32 with touchscreen display in a custom enclosure. | <img src="https://github.com/ChandlerEx/Projects/blob/bd44a9a6053a92f3da4370e4cfcf0bc38572fa22/Scoreboard/ScoreboardScore.jpg" alt="Scoreboard" width="150"/> |
| [**TheOrb**](./TheOrb) | Ambient LED orb that changes color based on live stock price performance. Powered by an ESP32 with custom PCB and 3D-printed shell. | <img src="StockPriceOrb/images/OrbThumb.jpg" alt="StockPriceOrb" width="150"/> |

## About Me
I’m Chandler, an IT pro turned maker, building a portfolio of embedded electronics builds that combine functional hardware, thoughtful design, and clean documentation. 
My aim is to create devices that are both technically solid, visually appealing, and suitable for real-world use.
